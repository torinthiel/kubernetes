Kuberentes experiments
======================

Some experiments with running kubernetes, etcd and the like.

Probably I'll try to run stuff in 3 distinct ways:

1) Standalone
2) As docker containers
3) Kubelet as 1) or 2) and control plane as static pods

All components configured directly, withoug things like `kubeadm`, with commands mostly taken from
[Kubernetes the hard way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way).
